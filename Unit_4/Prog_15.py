#Consider a user defined class called Time that records the time of the day.
# Create a new Time object and assign attributes for hours, minutes and seconds.
# Write a function called print_time that takes a Time object and
# prints it in the form hour:minute:second.
#  Write a boolean function called is_after that takes two Time objects, t1 and t2,
#  and returns True if t1 follows t2 chronologically and False otherwise.
# Write a function called increment which adds a given number of seconds to a Time object.
